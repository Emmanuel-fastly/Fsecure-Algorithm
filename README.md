This is a uni course project on cryptography. Implementing my own encryption algorithms in Python. The algorithm is heavily based on AES encryption algorithm.

## Check Algorithm.txt for the details of the algorithm implemented here.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Part 1**: Implementing the Key Expansion algorithm
2. **Part 2**: Implementing the Encryption algorithm
3. **Part 3**: Implementing the Decryption algorithm

The project is implemented in Python 3.7.3. The code is tested on Python 3.7.3 and Python 3.6.8.

## How to run the code
