This is a uni course project on cryptography. Implementing my own encryption algorithms in Python. The algorithm is heavily based on AES encryption algorithm.

## Check Algorithm.txt for the details of the algorithm implemented here.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Part 1**: Implementing the Key Expansion algorithm
2. **Part 2**: Implementing the Encryption algorithm
3. **Part 3**: Implementing the Decryption algorithm

## Algorithm implemented using Python

The project is implemented in Python3. The code is tested on Python 3 and above.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory and the Encryption folder
3. Run the test.py file
4. Modify the test.py file to test the algorithm with your own inputs
